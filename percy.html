                <p><b>Perseus "Percy" Jackson</b> is the beloved protagonist of <u>Rick Riordan’s</u> Percy Jackson & the Olympians series and a key figure in the Heroes of Olympus series. A <u>demigod</u> son of <u>Poseidon</u> (Greek god of the sea) and mortal Sally Jackson, Percy’s journey from a misunderstood teenager to a legendary hero has captivated millions. Known for his bravery, loyalty, and wit, he symbolizes resilience and hope in modern mythology.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2 id="History" class="h2-bg">History</h3>
                <h3>Early Life</h4>
                <p>Percy Jackson was born on August 18th, to Poseidon, the Greek god of the seas, storms, earthquakes, and the creator of horses, and Sally Jackson, a mortal who could see through the Mist. He was named after the famous Greek hero Perseus by his mother for good luck, because his namesake was one of the few heroes who had a happy ending and died a peaceful death.</p>
                <p>When Percy was still an infant, his father Poseidon left, as is usual of the gods, leaving Sally to raise Percy on her own. In Percy's case, Poseidon left to protect him and his mother from Zeus who would have been angered to discover that his brother broke the oath; a pact made by Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades, also known as the Big Three, to avoid having any more demigod children. As the most powerful Olympians, children of the Big Three wield incredible power and are seen as too dangerous to be brought into existence. Percy was left with vague memories of his father looking over him in his cradle; only remembering a warm smile, a hand on his head, and a "golden glow." At some point as an infant, Percy was attacked by a snake but managed to strangle it to death; just like the famous Greek demigod Heracles. As Percy grew older, his mother would tell him that his father had been "lost at sea," never confirming whether he was dead or alive.</p>
                <h3>Awakening of the demigod side</h3>
                <p>Strange things often happened around Percy, such as school buses exploding and aquariums flooding, which often resulted in him getting into trouble: he was kicked out of more than six schools over the course of six years. This unfortunately made Percy stand out. Many people bullied him during his childhood, while others, such as his second stepfather, Paul Blofis, suspected something was wrong with Percy and still accepted him. Paul was kind to Percy- even though he blew up his school music room.</p>
                <p>It is said in The Blood of Olympus that Percy has been kicked out of several military academies where they believed that paddling is good for the soul.</p>
                <p>When he was five, Percy went trick-or-treating in his apartment building and only got candy corn, getting sick afterwards.</p>
                <p>In The Chalice of the Gods, it's said that when Percy was six, he and his mother were flying a kite when it got struck by lightning by Zeus, in the middle of a sunny day.</p>
                <p>In third grade, Percy attended a school with a basement cafeteria and pizza days on Wednesdays. He would also discuss trading cards with his friends and the history teacher who was also their lunch monitor named Mr. Christ. Percy and his friends were too scared to ask what the teacher's first name was. However, neither being in third grade nor the pizza had been wonderful for Percy.</p>
                <p>While he was in the third grade, a man in a black trench coat followed Percy around when he was at school. After teachers threatened to call the police, the man left. However, nobody believed Percy when he said that the man had just one big eye. They thought that he was hallucinating.</p>
                <p>When he was in fourth grade on a trip to an aquarium, he accidentally hit the wrong lever on the catwalk when his school was visiting the Sea World Shark Pool and made his class take an "unplanned swim."</p>
                <p>In fifth grade, Percy accidentally fired a war cannon, which hit the school bus when he was on a field trip at the Saratoga Battlefield.</p>
                <p>He was raised by his mother, Sally Jackson, and abusive stepfather, Gabe Ugliano. He Learned his true parentage at age 12.</p>
                <p>Percy was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia, a trait that is common in demigods. He attended Camp Half-Blood after being attacked by a Minotaur, where he trained under Chiron, the centaur.</p>
